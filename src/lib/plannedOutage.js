// src/lib/plannedOutage.js
// OMS-01 crew-app rules for planned outages, kept free of React Native
// imports so they can be tested in Node (backend/src/selftest-oms01.js).
// The server enforces every rule again; these decide what the crew sees.
//
// Two different offline stories, on purpose (docs/OMS-01-DESIGN.md §7):
//  - Permits are a handshake with the control room: online only, never stored.
//  - A switching step done with no signal may be recorded on the phone, but it
//    shows as UNSYNCED (never green, never ticked) and unlocks nothing until
//    the server acknowledges it. It never goes through offlineQueue.js.

// Server not reached (no network, timeout) or failed on its side: keep the
// item and try again later. Anything else is the server refusing it.

//   unsynced      done here, not acknowledged: the control room doesn't know
